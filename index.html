            <p class="left">I started programming at age of 12 with fundamentals of Html <br>
            but i stopped because I didn't get the follow up and I was not <br>
            taking programming as my course but I stood up again after 3 years <br>
            when I got enrolled in Rwanda Coding Academy which were my dreams ...<br>

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p class="skills">
            I'm a software programming student at Rwanda Coding Academy who is willing<br>
            to become a front-end web programmer. Actually, at the beginning I wanted <br>
            to become a game developer and i have tried to make games like <a href=" https://gisele-123.github.io/Tic-tac-toe/">Tic-tac-toe</a><br>
            but I have read an article which made me change my mind and now i have seen<br>
            my passion directing me to web programming and I will be taking game designing<br>
            in my spare time.Basically, I started programming when I was 12, tinkering with<br>
            very simple website, It was really cool as it had been my long dreams to become<br>
            a game developer and i spent many hours of childhood lost in this game world by<br>
            watching movies which most of the times inspired me and made me love game development<br>
            much. At the age of 15, after getting enrolled in Rwanda Coding Academy I got chance<br>
            to know what difference is between WEB DEVELOPMENT and GAME DEVELOPMENT where I ended<br>
            up choosing Web developement other than game developement with a target of developing<br>
            cross-platform mobile and desktops apps to solve world problems.
            <br><br>
            In my spare time, you'll often find me trying to develop skills of game developement<br>
            because I do take a course for that also but not for profession. You'll also find me<br>
            watching famous web developers life, listening to songs or just planning out what's <br>
            next.
            <br><br>
            I hope to become a front-end wed programmer but that doesnot mean that i can't try on<br>
            designing and back-end but franklly I am more specialised in front-end web development.<br>
            Not only being a web developer only, I also hope to become an embedded software engineer.<br>
            Though it's had to combine both but I think it is better for me since I have more projects<br>
            concerning embedded system but those projects won't be done professionally. Professinally<br>
            I am a front-end web developer.<br><br>
